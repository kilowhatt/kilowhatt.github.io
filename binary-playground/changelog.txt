+ can convert bits to decimal
? how to display them

22/4
+ button to set all to 0 or 1
+ set int length 4,8,16,32 
+ .bit-changer class for buttons that change the int's value (asgore blike)
+ negate 
? keep lower bits (simulate info lost)
? negate needs to change display


23/4
+ cleaned up the code (visuals update all move to the update function)
:) bit doesnt update after changeing the length

. redesign layout
. clean up code in update length, the shrink is too weird
. clean up colors
. add index indicating power for each digit 
. different classes for different functions (bitshift, allswitch/neg, logic, +-)
. get better names bruh
. add a toggle switch to signed/unsigned int (need code)
. floats?
. one extra number for operations
. + -
. convert decinal input to binary display
. and or xor two numbers
. display in dec and hex
. help
. faq

. toggle groups of 4 on/off
. different update methods for signed/unsigned
